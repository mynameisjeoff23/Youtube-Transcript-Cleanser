#Youtube Trasncript Cleanser

This script will clean up the timestamps from transcripts copied from the youtube website. 

To use this: 
  1. Download the python script, either the source code or from releases.
  2. Copy the transcript from a youtube video. Go to the description, click "Show Transcript". A window will appear to the right. Select some text, then press CTRL+a, which should select all the text from the transcript. Copy the text.
  3. Paste the text into a .txt file called "original.txt" in the same folder as the python file.
  4. Run the python file.
